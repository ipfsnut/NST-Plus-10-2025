# NST Architecture Refinement Plan

## Phase 1: State Vector Implementation ✓
1. Complete State Vector Validation ✓
   - Added explicit state definitions in StateManager
   - Implemented transition validation
   - Added state guards
   - Defined clear state flow

2. Response System Enhancement ✓
   - Response handling through Redux middleware
   - Response batching in ResponsePipeline
   - Queue monitoring implemented
   - Timing metrics collection added

3. Media Operation Isolation ✓
   - Enhanced MediaHandler batch processing
   - Capture queue runs independently
   - Non-blocking storage operations
   - Recovery mechanisms in place

## Phase 2: Trial Progression Implementation
1. Frontend State Management ✓
   - Redux state shape defines trial/response/capture coordination ✓
   - ExperimentController subscribes to specific state segments ✓
   - Middleware handles async operation queuing ✓
   - State transitions trigger appropriate UI updates ✓

2. Digit Sequence Generation ✓
   - Implement MarkovChain digit generation per trial ✓
   - Add sequence validation ✓
   - Store generated sequences in trial metadata ✓
   - Add effort level progression logic ✓

3. Trial Completion (Priority)
   - Add 15-digit completion check
   - Implement trial boundary transitions
   - Add trial completion metrics
   - Update progress tracking

4. Controller Logic
   - Capture loop needs phase-based control
   - Trial count overflow needs bounds checking
   - Implement capture phase gating
   - Add trial bounds validation

5. Backend Operations
   - StateManager validates all transitions
   - Controllers handle stateless data recording
   - Clean API contracts for frontend consumption
   - Capture operations run independently

## Success Criteria
- Complete state vector validation ✓
- Zero sync errors in response-capture chain ✓
- Proper digit sequence generation per trial ✓
- Trial completion logic
- Smooth trial progression
- Reliable media operations
- Performance metrics within spec
