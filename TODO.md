# NST Architecture Refinement Plan

## Phase 1: State Vector Implementation ✓
1. Complete State Vector Validation ✓
   - Added explicit state definitions in StateManager
   - Implemented transition validation
   - Added state guards
   - Defined clear state flow

2. Response System Enhancement ✓
   - Response handling through Redux middleware
   - Response batching in ResponsePipeline
   - Queue monitoring implemented
   - Timing metrics collection added

3. Media Operation Isolation ✓
   - Enhanced MediaHandler batch processing
   - Capture queue runs independently
   - Non-blocking storage operations
   - Recovery mechanisms in place

## Phase 2: Trial Progression Implementation

1. Frontend State Management
   Files: frontend/redux/experimentSlice.js, frontend/components/ExperimentController.js
   Connection Points:
   - Redux state shape defines trial/response/capture coordination
   - ExperimentController subscribes to specific state segments
   - Middleware handles async operation queuing
   - State transitions trigger appropriate UI updates

2. Controller Logic
   Files: frontend/components/ExperimentController.js, frontend/components/ResponseHandler.js
   Connection Points:
   - ExperimentController manages trial flow through Redux actions
   - ResponseHandler validates and dispatches responses
   - Clear state machine transitions
   - Capture timing coordinated with responses

3. Backend Operations
   Files: backend/src/controllers/nstController.js, backend/src/services/stateManager.js
   Connection Points:
   - StateManager validates all transitions
   - Controllers handle stateless data recording
   - Clean API contracts for frontend consumption
   - Capture operations run independently

## Success Criteria
- Complete state vector validation ✓
- Zero sync errors in response-capture chain
- Smooth trial progression
- Reliable media operations
- Comprehensive error recovery
- Performance metrics within spec
