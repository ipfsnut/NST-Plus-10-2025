# NST Architecture Refinement Plan

## Phase 1: State Vector Implementation
1. Complete State Vector Validation
   - Add validation checks in experimentSlice.js
   - Implement sync verification in ResponsePipeline
   - Add transition guards in ServiceCoordinator
   - Track capture-response alignment

2. Response System Enhancement
   - Move response handling to Redux middleware
   - Add response batching in ResponsePipeline
   - Implement queue monitoring
   - Add timing metrics collection

3. Media Operation Isolation
   - Enhance MediaHandler batch processing
   - Add capture queue monitoring
   - Implement non-blocking storage operations
   - Add recovery mechanisms

## Phase 2: Performance Optimization
1. State Management
   - Migrate remaining local state to Redux
   - Implement efficient state updates
   - Add comprehensive transition logging
   - Optimize state subscriptions

2. Response Processing
   - Add response batching logic
   - Implement parallel processing
   - Add queue monitoring
   - Optimize storage operations

3. Capture System
   - Implement adaptive capture timing
   - Add device status monitoring
   - Optimize frame processing
   - Add capture verification

## Success Criteria
- Complete state vector validation
- Zero sync errors in response-capture chain
- Smooth trial progression
- Reliable media operations
- Comprehensive error recovery
