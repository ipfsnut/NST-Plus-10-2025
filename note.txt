NST Trial Progression Analysis

OBSERVED BEHAVIOR
1. Multiple Renders (Timestamps)
   - 1734123045831
   - 1734123045981 
   - 1734123045984
   - 1734123046332

2. State Flow
   - Session initializes correctly
   - First digit displays ('3')
   - Response validates successfully
   - Trial progression fails

ROOT CAUSE
The 500 error on GET /api/trial-state indicates the backend endpoint is either:
a) Not implemented
b) Not properly connected to state management
c) Missing from the router

This matches the "Cannot read trialNumber of undefined" error, suggesting the endpoint isn't returning the expected trial state object structure.

REQUIRED STRUCTURE
Trial state response should contain:
{
  currentDigit: string,
  trialState: {
    trialNumber: number
  }
}

NEXT STEPS
1. Implement /api/trial-state endpoint
2. Connect it to StateManager service
3. Ensure proper trial state object structure
4. Add error handling for state transitions

Note: Multiple renders are a separate optimization issue but not the primary blocker.
